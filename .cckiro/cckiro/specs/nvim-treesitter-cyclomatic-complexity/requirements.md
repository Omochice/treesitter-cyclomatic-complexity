# Requirements for nvim-treesitter Cyclomatic Complexity Plugin

## Overview
A Neovim plugin that displays cyclomatic complexity values next to functions and for loops using nvim-treesitter for code parsing.

## Functional Requirements

### R1: Code Parsing
- The plugin MUST use nvim-treesitter parsers to analyze source code
- The plugin MUST support multiple programming languages through treesitter parsers
- The plugin MUST identify function definitions and for loop constructs

### R2: Cyclomatic Complexity Calculation
- The plugin MUST calculate cyclomatic complexity for each function
- The plugin MUST calculate cyclomatic complexity for each for loop
- The complexity calculation MUST follow the standard formula: CC = E - N + 2P where:
  - E = number of edges in the control flow graph
  - N = number of nodes in the control flow graph  
  - P = number of connected components (usually 1 for a single function)
- The plugin MUST count the following control flow statements:
  - if/else statements
  - for loops
  - while loops
  - switch/case statements
  - try/catch statements
  - conditional operators (ternary)

### R3: Display Requirements
- The plugin MUST display cyclomatic complexity values next to the corresponding code elements
- The display MUST be non-intrusive and not interfere with code editing
- The plugin MUST use virtual text to show complexity values
- The complexity values MUST be updated when code changes

### R4: Performance Requirements
- The plugin MUST not significantly impact editor performance
- Complexity calculation MUST be performed asynchronously when possible
- The plugin MUST handle large files efficiently

### R5: Configuration Requirements
- Users MUST be able to enable/disable the plugin
- Users MUST be able to configure which complexity levels trigger warnings
- Users MUST be able to customize the display format
- Users MUST be able to enable/disable complexity display for specific construct types

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NF1: Compatibility
- The plugin MUST be compatible with Neovim 0.8+
- The plugin MUST require nvim-treesitter as a dependency
- The plugin MUST work with all languages supported by nvim-treesitter

### NF2: Code Quality
- The code MUST follow Lua coding conventions
- Each major feature MUST be implemented with separate commits using conventional commit format
- The code MUST be well-documented with inline comments

### NF3: Error Handling
- The plugin MUST gracefully handle parsing errors
- The plugin MUST not crash when encountering unsupported language constructs
- The plugin MUST provide meaningful error messages

## Implementation Phases
1. Treesitter node extraction for functions and for loops
2. Cyclomatic complexity calculation algorithm
3. Virtual text display integration

## Acceptance Criteria
- Functions and for loops show complexity values in virtual text
- Complexity calculations are accurate according to standard definitions
- Plugin works across multiple programming languages
- Performance remains acceptable in large codebases
- All features can be configured by users
